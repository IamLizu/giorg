### GIORG
A simplest website for your organization. Tell people about your org and the people who are behind **without coding**.  
All you have to do change demo information in the [AboutMain.json](https://github.com/IamLizu/giorg/blob/master/src/information/AboutMain.json). Changes you make will automatically take effect on the build. 

As its very simple, you will be able to show org name, a tagline, about and the people using the application. But you may see more features in next versions.  
Currently, org members are fetched from GitHub org. You may see other options in future release.

##### Getting Started
* Clone or download the repo
* Make your desired changes.
* Build app
* Publish

To build the project after making changes, run `npm run build`. This will create a static site which you will be able to host anywhere.  

You may work in development mode before building it, to see the changes you make taking effect as you make them. Execute `npm start` in the project directory, this runs the app in the development mode and usually opens a tab. If it doesn't, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  

You can learn more about creating react app in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
